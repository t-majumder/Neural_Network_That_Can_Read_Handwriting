# Neural_Network_That_Can_Read_Handwriting
The code implements a Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It preprocesses input images, trains the network with labeled data, and accurately classifies handwritten characters or digits. The code enables the model to interpret and recognize handwritten text with high accuracy.
